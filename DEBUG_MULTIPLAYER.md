# Multiplayer Debug Information

## Issue Summary
Both devices authenticate as the same user (34fc8c77-2526-4273-afe2-ea02283a12e3) even when using different browsers/accounts.

## What Works
- WebSocket connections establish correctly
- Room joining works (both users in room)
- Move broadcasting works (messages sent to both devices)
- Database stores correct game state

## What Doesn't Work
- Both devices authenticate as same user
- Turn validation fails because both devices think they're Player X
- Player O moves are rejected with "not your turn"

## Required for Fix
1. Device 1: Must authenticate as User A (Sam - a7b6cf23-e9d0-425f-924d-9acd10560370)
2. Device 2: Must authenticate as User B (Yogesh - 34fc8c77-2526-4273-afe2-ea02283a12e3)

## Testing Steps
1. Open app on Device 1, check user ID in top-right corner
2. Open app on Device 2 (different browser/incognito), check user ID
3. Both should show different user IDs
4. If same user ID appears on both devices, authentication system needs fixing

## Current Status
- Room participants: ✓ Both users correctly stored
- Game state: ✓ Correct X/O assignments in database
- WebSocket: ✓ Broadcasting works
- Authentication: ❌ Both devices same user session
